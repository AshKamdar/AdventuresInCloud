# Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure offers hosted kubernetes service wherein it manages  kubernetes master nodes for you and you are responsible for managing worker nodes (VMs on which workloads are hosted).

__Master nodes__ are also referred as __Control Plane__ of Kubernetes and __Worker nodes__ are referred to as __Data plane__ of kubernetes.

This reduces much of complexity and operational overhead of managing kubernetes control plane and keeping it running in a high available and secure environment setup. Azure takes care of critical tasks like health monitoring and maintenance for us in the event of any issues encountered while running kubernetes clusters.
