# Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure offers hosted kubernetes service wherein it manages  kubernetes master nodes for you and you are responsible for managing worker nodes (VMs on which your workdloads are hosted).

Master nodes are also referred as Control Plane where as worker nodes are referred to as Data plane of kubernetes.

This reduces much of complexity and operational overhead of managing kubernetes control plane and keeping it running in a high available and secure environment setup. Azure takes care of critical tasks like health monitoring and maintenance for us in the event of any issues encountered while running kubernetes clusters.
